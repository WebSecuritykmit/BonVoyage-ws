Pilgrims visiting the Temple have to cross the Kumaradhara River and take a holy dip in it before entering the temple. According to Mythology, Lord Kumaraswamy killed the demon rulers Taraka, Shoorapadmasura in a war; and washed his Shakti Ayudha in this river (hence the river is named Kumaradhara).

Sarpa Samskara/Sarpa Dosha is one of the poojas performed at this temple by devotees to get rid of the sarpa dosha. Kukke subramanya can be reached by road from Mangalore and Bangalore.</p>

This temple enshrines the monolithic statue of Bhagvan Bahubali (Gomatheshwara) which is 39 foot high. Sculpted by the famous Renjala Gopalkrishna Shenoi, it was completed in 1973 and installed in 1982. 

Bharata and his younger brother Bahubali, both of royal birth, fought each other in a battle for supremacy. Bharata lost the battle but his life was spared. Bahubali then realized the futility of war and killing to acquire power. He handed over his kingdom to his brother and became a member of the Digambara Jain sect. He began a severe penance, standing naked until he gained enlightenment

The Maha Masthakaabhisheka festival, sacred bathing of the statue with saffron paste, milk and water, held once in every 12 years.
